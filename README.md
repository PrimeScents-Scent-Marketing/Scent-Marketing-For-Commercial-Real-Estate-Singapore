How PrimeScents Works

PrimeScents is a fully managed, “white glove” scenting service, designed to deliver a premium fragrance experience that enhances the value and ambiance of Singapore’s most prestigious properties.

Scent Design and Selection: Premium-Grade, Fine Fragrance

PrimeScents offers only premium-grade “fine fragrance,” crafted to the standards of luxury perfumes—not a cheap or chemically-scented alternative. This makes PrimeScents the preferred choice for premium real estate, setting properties apart with a high-end, sophisticated scent profile that enhances their allure. Developed by Equal Strategy in collaboration with Drom—who have created iconic fragrances for BVLGARI, Gucci, Christian Dior, Chanel, and other luxury brands—our signature scents are meticulously selected to create a welcoming, pleasant ambiance that resonates with tenants and clients alike. Equal Strategy has proudly partnered with Drom since 2006, leveraging their expertise to create a truly unique and memorable fragrance experience.

Advanced, Commercial-Grade Fragrance Delivery Systems

PrimeScents utilizes commercial-grade scent diffusion systems built for reliability and consistent performance. Backed by Equal Strategy’s 20 years of expertise in scenting corporate environments, our equipment ensures even, subtle scenting across all areas of your property, creating a cohesive and inviting atmosphere without overpowering the space. Our systems are built for durability and seamlessly integrate with high-end property infrastructure.

White Glove Installation and Maintenance

PrimeScents provides a fully managed, “white glove” service that requires no additional effort from property management. From initial consultation and placement assessment to installation and testing, our expert technicians handle every step to ensure flawless integration with your property.

Quarterly Refill and Replacement Services

Our “white glove” service includes a proactive maintenance schedule, with scent bottle refills every three months to keep your property’s ambiance fresh and inviting year-round, as well as eliminating the need for 'inefficient monthly refills'.  In the rare event of equipment malfunction, PrimeScents guarantees prompt replacement at no extra charge, so your property remains consistently fragrant without interruption. This fully managed, high-touch service is tailored for properties that demand the best, providing a worry-free experience with the assurance of premium quality.

A Proven Strategy for Premium Real Estate

PrimeScents is inspired by successful scent branding strategies implemented by renowned brands like Abercrombie & Fitch, Disney, and Singapore Airlines, who use fragrance to enhance their brand experience and customer loyalty. Equal Strategy brings this level of expertise to your property, helping you establish a distinct sensory identity that enhances your property’s appeal and leaves a lasting impression on tenants and visitors.
